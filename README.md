## Note: Turn off Instant Run when building

[Sugar ORM](https://github.com/chennaione/sugar), a library being used in this app, does not work well with Instant Run. You will have to turn the feature off on Android Studio when building the app. You can do this by: 
  * File --> Settings --> Build, Execution, Deployment --> Instant Run --> Uncheck Enable instant run.
